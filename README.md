**#INTRODUCTION**

After the completion of the use of Excel for data analysis, the instructor gave a task to test the understanding of what has been learned so far. She provided us with a sales data of a US superstore. Participants are required to come up with questions on their own and also provide solutions to the problem created.

Data has been cleaned. So, the next thing is to dive into action
